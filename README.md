CALIPER (Critical thinking, Analysis, Logic, Integrative thinking, Problem solving, Ethics, and Reasoning) is a conceptual assessment framework designed to evaluate the reasoning and cognitive skills of both humans and large language models (LLMs). This repository is currently in the early stages of developmentâ€”we are gathering and organizing various components, ideas, and research to form a comprehensive assessment tool.

## Overview

The CALIPER framework is centered on evaluating seven key dimensions:

- **Critical Thinking:**  
  Analyze, evaluate, and synthesize information in a logical and systematic way. This involves questioning assumptions, recognizing biases, and evaluating evidence to form well-informed, objective conclusions.

- **Analysis:**  
  Break down complex information into manageable components. Through detailed examination of structure, relationships, and patterns, analysis helps in identifying key elements and drawing informed conclusions.

- **Logic:**  
  Study and apply principles that distinguish correct reasoning from incorrect reasoning. Logic involves assessing whether conclusions follow necessarily from given premises using structured methods like deductive or inductive reasoning.

- **Integrative Thinking:**  
  Combine and synthesize diverse perspectives and ideas to address complex problems. This skill is about balancing conflicting viewpoints to develop a cohesive, innovative approach that transcends binary choices.

- **Problem Solving:**  
  Identify challenges, analyze obstacles, and develop effective solutions. Problem solving is a structured process involving problem definition, information gathering, ideation, evaluation, and implementation of the best solution.

- **Ethics:**  
  Explore moral principles and values that guide behavior. Ethics examines what is considered right and wrong, and informs decisions that align with societal and individual values such as fairness, justice, and responsibility.

- **Reasoning:**  
  Engage in systematic thought processes to form conclusions, make decisions, and solve problems. Reasoning connects ideas and facts through valid arguments, employing both deductive and inductive strategies to justify conclusions.

## Purpose

CALIPER is designed with two primary objectives:

1. **Human Assessment:**  
   To serve as a tool for self-assessment and educational evaluation, enabling individuals to understand and improve their cognitive and reasoning skills.

2. **LLM Evaluation:**  
   To provide a standardized framework for benchmarking the performance of language models. This will be particularly useful for researchers and developers seeking to assess and enhance the reasoning capabilities of AI systems.

## Current Status

**Work in Progress:**  
At this stage, the repository is dedicated to gathering all the conceptual pieces, research, and ideas needed to build the CALIPER assessment framework. There is no executable code available yet. As the project evolves, executable components, scripts, and evaluation tools will be added.
