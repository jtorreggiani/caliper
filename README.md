## Critical Thinking

Critical thinking is the ability to analyze, evaluate, and synthesize information in a logical and systematic way. It involves questioning assumptions, recognizing biases, and examining evidence to form reasoned conclusions. Critical thinkers are able to assess the validity of arguments, identify logical fallacies, and make decisions based on rational evaluation rather than emotional reactions or unfounded beliefs. Essentially, it is a disciplined approach to thinking that helps individuals make well-informed, objective judgments.
